# MarkLogic Solution Template on Azure

The Solution Template for MarkLogic on Azure helps to deploy clusters on Azure. It is publicly offered on Azure Marketplace. This repository contains templates and resources to set up and initialize MarkLogic clusters with Azure features: Availability Set, Virtual Network, Application Gateway, Network Security Group, Virtual Machines, etc. MarkLogic features such as local-disk failover will be configured for the cluster.

## Reference Architecture

The Solution Template exposes a set of parameters enabling users to configure the MarkLogic cluster on Azure. Using the parameter values, users can choose to provision one node or three node clusters with Aazure features including Availability Set, Virtual Network, Application Gateway, Network Security Group, and Virtual Machines.

The virtual machines provisioned by the template will each be initialized as a MarkLogic node and joined together as a cluster. Advanced features including MarkLogic local-disk failover can be also configured on the cluster. The following image shows a typical architecture of the cluster on Azure.

The Solution Template consists of a mainTemplate, createUiDefinition, several sub-templates, and shell scripts for configuring MarkLogic cluster. The mainTemplate is the main entrance of the template. It links and invokes sub-templates as needed. The createUiDefinition is used to define Azure Marketplace interface. If you are deploying from this repository or using Azure CLI, createUiDefinition won't be used.
